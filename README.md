# Pokedex
Every Pokemon nerd slash programmer faces this battle at some point during their journey. It's a rite of passage, inevitable and unskippable, kind of like foraging wild ingredients in the Lush Jungle for the Grass trial or surviving Lana's terrible jokes on Brooklet Hill.
Thus, I have dove in. I have started putting together a Pokedex.
Kind of. Mostly just crying. My tears flow smoothly like a gentle spring; my code, alas, does not. 

## What Is This?
A Pokedex. You know, the gadget every professor ever thrusts right into your empty, calluses-free hands before sending you out to ̶m̶a̶k̶e̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶i̶r̶ ̶j̶o̶b̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶ start you off on your Pokemon quest? Yeah, it's exactly that but :sparkles:broken:sparkles:.

## Features
- Displays a list of Pokemon in colors that might not burn your eyes
- You can actually filter the Pokémon with three parameters: name, generation it was introduced in, and type(s) (you can select multiple and get all the Pokémon who have at least one (1) of the selected types)
- Shows the details of your selected Pokemon with a toggleable sprite (male/female/genderless + vanilla/shiny) and the base stats

## Known issues
- Talks back like Bianca to her dad
- It has more bugs than a Bug-type gym but without Burgh's dramatic flair

## WIP
- Polishing the Pokemon details page + presenting evolution trees somewhat nicely
- Adding natures
- Greeting the user with a main page. Yes, there is no main page yet
- Tidying up the items in the Pokemon list
